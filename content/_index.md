Title: "About Me"
---

My name is Nicole and I am an aspiring computer animator who is currently studying computer animation at Ringling College of Art and Design. I find joy in creating stories and characters that people can connect with, especially by bringing my projects to life through lighting, texture work, and creating the animated emotions of the characters. Through these mediums, I can explore the many possibilities that come with it to include additional care and details into my projects. Playing with style through texturing and adjusting the mood and other nuances through lighting and animation are aspects that I am greatly passionate about.

When I am not delving into the animation world, I love to discover new places to eat with friends and family, sitting around the table with them and catching up with each other. It is yet another way I enjoy connecting with others.
